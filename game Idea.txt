Here is the first pass of what I was think for the game: user is greated with a circle on screen, game play starts with one bar moving up from behind the circle on screen, user can tap the bar and once the bar is tapped the suer is rewarded with set point value then a particle of cirles like paint splatters shows and the bar is removed, or have the animation play back to the center of the circle, as the user progresses throw the game more bars are shown as the time goes on, if the user misses one bar game is over. the goal of the game is to see how long of a streak you can get. once the user has 5 bars on screen we can interduce combo's 2 or more of the same color can be tapped at the same time or with in a set time appart from one another, this will reward the user with more points then a single bar.
